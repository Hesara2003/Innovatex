# Branch plan â€” Dilusha

Branch: `dilusha`

Primary focus: streaming server, client tooling, and infra glue.

Tasks
- Stabilize `streaming-server/stream_server.py` and default flags.
- Improve sample clients (`streaming-clients/*`).
- Create `src/io/stream_reader.py` to normalize messages.
- Provide `scripts/dev_start.ps1` to launch server/clients easily.
