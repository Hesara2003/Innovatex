# Sandali â€” CX Analytics & Demo

Focus: queue + dwell analytics, storytelling, and packaging for judges.

## Scope
- Compute queue states and dwell-time KPIs from `queue_monitoring.jsonl`.
- Summarize CX issues (friction, anomalies) and actionable recommendations.
- Prepare `evidence/executables/run_demo.py` UX: clear prints, timing, outputs.
- Create a 2-minute demo script aligned with `SUBMISSION_GUIDE.md`.

## Deliverables
- `src/analytics/queue_metrics.py` producing KPIs.
- A concise `DEMO_SCRIPT.md` and slides (optional).
- `results/` artifacts structured and labeled for judges.

## Milestones
- M1: KPI functions with unit tests.
- M2: Demo dry-run < 2 minutes; prints concise narrative.
- M3: Final polish and evidence folder complete.
